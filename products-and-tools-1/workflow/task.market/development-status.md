# Development Status

In October 2018 Task.Market was released under the brand MyBit DDF \(Decentralised Development Fund\). It was powered by OpenBounty by Status.IM.

In December 2018 it was migrated to Gitcoin due to Status no longer maintaining OpenBounty and it being developed in Clojure, which MyBit did not have the personnel to take over development.

In January 2019 development began for governance using Aragon.

In February 2019 it was rebranded as Task.Market

In March 2019, testing for voting and governance will begin.

Voting and governance is planned to be released live in Q2 2019, although this may be delayed by unexpected variables since blockchain-based governance is still in its infancy. At this time, funding will still occur manually from the Task.Market multi-signature wallet.

In Q4 2019 there is a planned release for the implementation of a funding DAO so Task.Market becomes one of the first major fully decentralised and autonomous applications \(A DAO in itself that helps build and develop other DAOs\).

In 2020 the focus will be segregating the main funding DAO into specific funding DAOs for major products such as MyBit Go and MYDAX which are generating profits to sustain itself.
