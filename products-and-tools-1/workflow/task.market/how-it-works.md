# How it Works

**Introduction**

The future of Task.Market is a decentralised set-up with a funding DAO and governance models. This means that anyone from the community can propose a new idea, feature, marketing plan, etc. and the MyBit Tokenholders can vote on it. Then funding will automatically be allocated by a funding DAO.

\*In the initial release, MyBit chooses the tasks and assigns the financial value. This will be deprecated once governance is implemented.

**The Process**

1. A user has an idea for a new features for MyBit Go and they propose it to the community.
2. The community votes on it and assigns a monetary value to have it developed.
3. If approved via community vote, the task is listed on Task.Market and open to anyone to complete. It is automatically funded from the funding DAO for MyBit Go.
   1. The Funding DAO is capitalised with 50% of contributions from phase 2 of the token distribution and continuously from fees assigned to the product, which is expanded on in the next section, "Self Sustaining Products
4. Once completed, merged, and implemented into the live product, payment is made automatically via smart contracts.
