# About

Task.Market is a layer over bounties network which makes it simple for communities to lead projects instead of centralised companies. This is done through the integration of DAOs and other governance structures.

Task.Market was founded for two core reasons. First, we believe that development of decentralised applications should not rely on centralised teams. Second, there is a massive change in the global workflow - people no longer want to work at one job, restricted to one location, with strict hours \(i.e 9-5\), but would prefer flexibility, freedom, and working on a variety of different projects. 

1. Migrating development from centralised to decentralised

The current market volatility \(Q3, Q4 2018 and Q1 2019\) was largely caused by _us_, token-financed startups. We all messed up and followed the model of building decentralised applications and communities through centralised companies. This promoted speculation, where anyone could “invest” in a vision which would be brought to life by a small group of individuals. This model did not incentivise stakeholders to contribute nor play active roles in bringing the vision to reality. Instead, it created a somewhat hostile environment where the “investors” sat back and relied fully on a centralised company to do all the work.

From the start, the token financing model has been designed to monetise open source projects. Open source projects should be grown through the collective intelligence and contributions of a community. 

It also created immense risk where if a centralised company disappeared, the product would die. Additionally, if a dApp is managed by a centralised authority, i.e we held the private keys to the multi-sigs which deploy the contracts for the dApp, then it defeats the whole point of decentralisation. 

2. Workflows need to be re-imagined

The concept of, “come to an office at this specific location, from 9–5 Monday — Friday, and get paid to do what I tell you” isn’t the way forward.

* It’s not efficient. The human body is not designed to work optimally for long periods of time. This leads to employees being unproductive for nearly half of every “workday.” This wastes company money — and people’s time.
* It’s bad for people and actually reduces freedom. When someone is restricted to a specific location and time period when it comes to work, they are severely limited in what they can do _outside_ of work. Over time this negatively affects mental health and wellbeing and, in turn, leads to a large reduction in the quality of work and overall productivity. We believe in a future where people have _more_ freedom to do what they choose, from where they choose. And we’re starting by putting this at the heart of the MyBit workflow.
* Hourly rates are unfair and incentivise reduced efficiency. If two people are working on the same task and it takes one of them two hours to complete and the other takes six hours to complete the task — assuming the quality of the output work is the same — shouldn’t the person who completed it more efficiently in less time be rewarded? Instead, under the current hourly model, it rewards the person who took longer. This doesn’t make sense because it \(again\) wastes company resources as well as individuals’ time. What’s worse, this model actually incentivises counter-productivity.
* It eliminates our most useful trait as human beings which differentiates us significantly from other living organisms: collective intelligence. When we are told what to do and follow orders blindly, we lose what makes us human and operate more akin to a robot. To truly build great products and — ultimately — a better world, there needs to be tools and procedures in place which enable everyone to contribute and collaborate collectively.
* It’s also bad for products. Products should be designed and evolve based on users and their specific needs. Sure, many companies utilise a low-level form of AI or data analysis to attempt to come up with an idea as to what their users desire. However, at the end of the day, it is always an individual or small group that infers a conclusion from the data and decides what recommendations to implement.

This model has worked relatively well to date, but the real result is profit-focused products, not user-focused products. We believe that the one thing that could potentially be more powerful than AI is _collective intelligence_, which follows democratic principles, and specifically promotes user-focused products. We just need to create the tools, organisational structures, and incentive models necessary for truly tapping into the true power of collective intelligence. At MyBit, we think the majority of these tools exist, they just have not been implemented correctly to date. We will be working on testing out our theories throughout 2019 and beyond.
