# About

The MyBit Transparency Portal was designed as an application that plugs into Basecamp \(workflow tool\) to provide real time insights into the development process, roadmaps, targets, communications, and overall projects being developed on MyBit.

To enable a community of contributors it is imperative that information is easily accessible and always updated. We found that the simplest way to achieve this was through enabling anyone to see what the MyBit team is working on in real time without having to conduct additional work to share the content and progress.
