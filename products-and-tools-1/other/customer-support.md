# Customer Support

This is a future plan for MyBit. Creating a decentralised customer service application to service our products and DAOs. It let's anyone respond and receive payment for resolving the question or concern. This is another MyBit project which is a business in itself and can be replicated across all companies, including those outside of the blockchain ecosystem.

We are still determining the source of funding for the payouts. If it comes out of the funding DAO for the product or users submitting questions much escrow a small amount until they confirm the question has been answered, then it is released from the smart contract to the user who answered the question.
