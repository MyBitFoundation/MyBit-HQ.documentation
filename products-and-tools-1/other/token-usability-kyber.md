# Token Usability \(Kyber\)

In February 2019 we began working with Kyber.Network to increase token usability.

The first phase of this was implemented in MyBit Go in March 2019 to enable anyone to invest in assets with any Kyber supported cryptocurrency and it is automatically converted to DAI on the back-end. 

You can view the code on the following github links:

The next phase will be to enable any user to pay dApp fees \(MYB\) without having to hold MYB. On the back-end they are converted into MYB and burnt, all without the user seeing the process.
