# Anti-Spam Communication

This is a future plan of MyBit. Where if someone asks a questions or submits a form of communication, they must escrow an amount of MYB. If the question is determined to be spam then the tokens are burnt, if it is a legitimate enquiry then the MYB is returned.

This is far from being developed as there are still many aspects that need to be researched.
