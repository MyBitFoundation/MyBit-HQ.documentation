# Development Status

The MyBit Go MVP was released in July 2017 prior to the start of phase 1 of the token distribution.

In October 2017, the architecture was determined to be changed, and Jose Aguinaga \(CTO\) joined the team and took the lead.

The design team began working on a new concept in November 2017.

As of January 2018, the core smart contracts \(with required basic functionality for investing\) were completed.

In February 2018, a new design was put into effect and development of the front end began.

Between February 2018 and September 2018, the smart contracts were expanded and the front end was developed, smart contracts were integrated, and the alpha was released.

In October 2018, the MyBit SDK was released making it easy for anyone to develop similar investment focused decentralised applications \(dApps\).

In December 2019, the MyBit Go beta was released on testnet prior to the start of phase 2 of the token distribution. This included all functionality outside of governance and placing MYB as asset collateral.

It is planned to migrate towards a more community involved development workflowing leveraging Task.Market in March 2019.

The mainnet release is planned for Q2 2019. This will not include governance or decentralised partnership onboarding.

Through the end of 2019, the focus will be implementing governance, decentralised onboarding of IoT Partners, and transitioning MyBit Go into one of the first DAOs on mainnet.
