# Hedge Funds

The goal of this is to create an solution for anyone to easily create their own hedge fund DAO in a matter of minutes. All they need to do is input the investment criteria and/or algorithm, what % of the fund profits they want to own in return for the formula they curated, and deploy it so it is open for investors to contribute to.

The first use case of this is planned to be for MYDAX. Instead of having order book matching like forkdelta it incorporates DAOs which are configured to auto-purchase if specifications are met. Then it will be expanded to other cryptographic assets.

**How it works \(For MYDAX\)**  
  
I have 1 unit of a solar farm I want to sell.  
Normal decentralised exchange. I would say I want to sell 1 unit for xxx price. If no buy orders were in there already then it would get added to the order book And it would get listed and then a buyer would have to buy it for that price.  
MYDAX. I want to sell 1 unit of a solar farm, I click sell and see offers \(of DAOs who will buy it\) and choose which one I want. Or automatically chooses the one that offers the most and just goes through without having to choose \(that's ideal\) - maybe in the UI we can have an option to 1. choose best price or 2. manually select.  
  
So for this to work it has to be easy for anyone to create DAOs that automatically buy assets.  
  
For example. I create a DAO that can be funded up to $100,000 and will automatically purchase \(Max $ amount or % of free capital in DAO\) any solar investment in \(region\) which has been generating revenue for \(time period active\) and has averaged returns of \(xx.xxx%\).   
  
So it could look like. Auto purchase up to $1,000 \(or 1% of free capital in DAO\) of any solar investment in Europe which has been around for &gt;6 months and has average monthly returns of 2%.   
  
Then I launch this, people can contribute to this to fund the DAO, and then when someone goes to sell a solar unit in Europe that meets that criteria it automatically buys up to $1,000 worth of it.  


**Uses of MYB**

  
To deploy a DAO hedge fund it  requires that an amount of MYB be burnt. It will consist of a simple web-interface for that \(and doesn't need to be specific to just MYDAX, it can be applicable to any cryptographic token.  
  
\*This is a work in progress and will be updated as development progresses.
