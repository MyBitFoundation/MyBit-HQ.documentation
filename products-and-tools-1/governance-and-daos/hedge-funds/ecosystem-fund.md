# Ecosystem Fund

The goal of the ecosystem fund is to stimulate new growth. It lets anyone contribute \(“lock”\) MYB to the fund and award it to development teams which have been chosen to join the fund and have achieved certain milestones.

All contributors to the fund will have a voting right to select new projects. In return for funding a project, a portion of the applications future revenue will be returned to the fund.

### How does it Work?

1. Holders of MYB contribute tokens to the fund.
2. Development teams follow the application process with their idea.
3. Investors of the fund vote to accept or reject a proposal using Blockchain governance protocols.
4. If accepted, MYB is escrowed in a smart contract and released to the development team in increments after set milestones are achieved.
5. Upon approval, funds are distributed from the smart contract.

Successful applications can then join the DDF to rapidly scale development.

\*This is still a work in progress and will be updated as development progresses.
