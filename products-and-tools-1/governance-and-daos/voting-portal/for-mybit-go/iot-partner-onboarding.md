# IoT Partner Onboarding

Our goal is to decentralised MyBit Go and migrate it into a DAO throughout 2019. To achieve this, it requires new partners to be able to be onboarded by the community. 

The process consists of:

1. An IoT company integrates the MyBit Go Partners API which includes sharing necessary data and enabling direct payouts to investors via smart contracts. 
   1. If they are unable to integrate internally, they can coordinate a job on Task.Market to have someone from the MyBit community do it for them in return for a fee or potentially a revenue sharing agreement. 
   2. If someone from the community brought the IoT company to the ecosystem \(not including integration, so non-technical community members are encouraged to conduct this as well\) they may be entitled to receive a percentage of received funding as a sort of referral fee. 
2. It is then submitted for a community vote \(approve or reject\) where the company shares its details, financials, and technical implementation can be tested.
3. If approved, the asset is then made available for asset managers to list to be funded.

\*This is a work in progress and will be updated as we progress.
