# Asset Managers

 If an asset manager fails to perform their duties then investors can vote to remove them. If this occurs than any MYB held in collateral is burnt.

 Any investors in the asset can initiate a vote of no confidence and other investors can vote to remove the asset manager and replace with a new one.

\*This is a work in progress and will be updated as we progress.
