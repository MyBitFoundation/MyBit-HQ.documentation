# Overview

The MyBit DAO decentralises the decision making process around actions taken within the MyBit ecosystem. It is specifically designed to let users easily control the direction of the products and services they use on the MyBit Network. In combination with the automation already leveraged within the MyBit Network, the MyBit DAO is a huge step towards creating the most efficient, effective, and responsive financial services ecosystem that exists in the world today.

The MyBit DAO is powered by Aragon and can be viewed [here](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/0xcD3d9b832BfF15E0a519610372c6AAC651872DdE/).
