# ERC721 Community Rankings

When building a decentralised organisation it is important to incorporate organisational tools to keep track of the roles of contributors and allow for upward progression.

MyBit is conducting this through non-fungible tokens \(NFTs\) following the Ethereum ERC721 specifications and voting models. 

Our vision is to create a business model where everyone has equal opportunity regardless of background, who they know, experience, etc. Everyone starts at the same level and grows through contributions, not monetary value.

No rankings can be purchased or influenced solely by popularity; instead, the focus is on contributions and playing an active role — no matter the size.

By implementing community status rankings through ERC721 tokens this will, in theory, create a decentralised hierarchy-like structure to organise the ecosystem. Elected positions will often require a minimum ranking for someone to be eligible for the voting ballot. While this may prevent speedy attacks, it will ultimately rely on incentive structures to deter long-term foul play. We are working to find a balance where the time required and value received exceeds any short-term attack reward.
