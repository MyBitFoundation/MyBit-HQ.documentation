# Wills

MyBit Will let's anyone distribute their cryptographic assets without the excessive expenses and time of lawyers. 

This enables cryptographic assets to automatically be transferred to recipients upon death of issuer.

Currently, to prove the issuer is still alive they must log in and verify by signing a transaction before a pre-defined period they choose expires.

\*This is a work in progress. Please check the [application](https://will.mybit.io/) periodically for updates or check out open tasks on [Task.Market](https://task.market)
