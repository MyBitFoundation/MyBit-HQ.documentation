# Roadmap

The proof of concept smart contracts were released in Q2 2018. This consisted of being able to trade \(buy/sell\) MyBit Go assets.

Comprehensive Research began for MYDAX in Q3 2018. The main focus was usability and differentiating from common, difficult to use DEX's.

Technical collaboration began in Q1 2019.

Alpha release is planned for late Q3 2019.

Mainnet release is planned for Q1 2020. This date is subject to change due to being so far out in the future and many unknown variables may slow the development process.
