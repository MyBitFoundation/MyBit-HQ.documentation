# General Information

The MyBit Network is powered by the MyBit Token \(MYB\). MYB serves as fuel for the network, powering transactional functions within the MyBit SDK and therefore serving a central role across the majority of MyBit dApps and products.  


MyBit Tokens are burned as a normal function of the working network similarly to gas on the Ethereum network. MYB can also be staked for voting, exchanged for other tokens, locked when investing in longer term projects through the MyBit Ventures fund, and many more uses.
