# Voting

For the MyBit DAOs to function as desired, community voting by a majority of stakeholders is necessary. We encourage every holder of MYB to join the [MyBit DAO](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xCE03775BCeA4760923cfDA2f2BD9f295e28e8AB3/0x986750c62b7cde4926660a8dc45675f6852866d6) and check in atleast once per week to vote on decisions or initiate new proposals. This engagement is important for the MyBit Ecosystem to be truly decentralised and community driven. Voting via the MyBit DAO gives all community members an equal voice in driving the direction and vision of not just individual projects, but the overall MyBit Ecosystem.
