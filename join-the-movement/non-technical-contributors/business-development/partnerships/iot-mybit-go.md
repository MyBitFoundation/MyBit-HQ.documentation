# IoT \(MyBit Go\)

MyBit Go looks for partners in the IoT industry who manufacture and/or distribute assets that generate revenue by providing a good or service \(i.e Bitcoin ATM, Smart-lock powered real-estate, 3d printers, etc.\) - anything that can be connected to the internet and managed by an IoT cloud is eligible to be listed on MyBit Go.

When analysing partners please make sure they meet the following criteria:

1. Company was established and began operations atleast 3 years ago.
2. Founders have a good reputation and company has no cases of fraud or negative reviews
3. Revenue exceeds CHF 250,000 per annum
4. IoT device can be integrated with MyBit Go's "Partners API" \(coming soon\) and they accept to the terms of it including, but not limited to, the sharing of data and managing payments through the Ethereum Blockchain.
5. Life span of asset is a minimum of 5 years
6. Asset generates an attractive return to investors \(typically greater than 5% per annum\)
7. They can distribute assets globally \(this is not mandatory but the larger their supply chain network is, the more chances of being successful on the MyBit Go platform\)

If a company meets the following criteria, then we encourage community members to reach out to them to assess interest. They can also share the "Partners Deck" \(coming soon\). In return for onboarding new partners, the community member who brought them into the ecosystem is entitled to a percentage of the total assets funded by that IoT company \(amount TBD\).

The process for onboarding partners \(in development\)

1. IoT company integrates into the MyBit Go Partners API
2. IoT company shares their company profile, financials, and assures they meet outlined criteria
3. Community votes on accepting or rejecting the IoT company via the MyBit Go DAO.
4. If approved, the assets of the IoT company are then available for asset managers to list.
