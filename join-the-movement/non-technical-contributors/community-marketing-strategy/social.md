# Social

To help increase the growth of MyBit social channels and overall exposure, it is helpful for community members to repost and share content that is relevant to their own networks. Also engage with answering questions and debating comments on posts. Another way to help with brand awareness is to change your profile pictures to the MyBit Logo or a similar image. Additionally if you hear any exciting news about MyBit, write your own post and share on your social channels!
