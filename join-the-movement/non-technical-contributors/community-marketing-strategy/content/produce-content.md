# Produce Content

Just like hosting events, it is often more effective to build trust and faith in a project by reading and viewing content from supporters unaffiliated with the company \(aka MyBit's core team\). There are many methods to produce valuable content and it can consist of both written and video. For example topics can include:

1. Educational - explain to new or existing supporters how some aspect of the MyBit Ecosystem or a specific product works.
2. Technical - discuss the technical aspects of anything within the MyBit Ecosystem, including both positive and negative aspects - do not be afraid to mention flaws.
3. Opinionated - if you have a strong opinion \(positive or negative\) about something, share it and maybe it turns into a debate or results in an aspect of the MyBit Ecosystem being changed.
4. Reviews - share your honest, un-biased feedback of the entire MyBit Ecosystem or a specific aspect, product, etc. of it.
5. Guides - create walk throughs to help new users navigate the complexity of using decentralised applications and understand the value of using it. Or explain how to contribute to the projects.
6. Mission/Vision - share your vision for MyBit, an abstract concept that MyBit ties into, or even why you joined the MyBit community and what you hope to achieve through it.
7. And anything else!

You do not have to be a skilled or professional writer to produce amazing content, just start writing and see where it goes! If you want feedback or reviews before publishing, then share with our community on [https://t.me/mybitio](https://t.me/mybitio) and gather opinions first!
