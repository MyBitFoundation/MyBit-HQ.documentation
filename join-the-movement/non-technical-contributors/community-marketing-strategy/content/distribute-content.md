# Distribute Content

Once your content is written, it is time to distribute it so readers can find it. Follow these steps to begin building an audience.

1. Create content distribution accounts. For written material we suggest Medium and Steemit. For Videos we suggest YouTube and Vimeo.
2. Publish the content and share on your social media accounts. Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and LinkedIN have the best results, but share on as many as you have!
3. Post in groups on Facebook, LinkedIN, Telegram groups, Bitcointalk threads, and subreddits to get exposure outside of your own network. \(Make sure to respond to questions and debate comments if applicable\)
4. Encourage others in your network to share and repost so get exponentially larger exposure to new readers. An easy option is to post on the [MyBit Telegram](https://t.me/mybitio) to ask other supporters to share as well.
5. If you are feeling highly ambitious then reach out to influential bloggers, medium publications, blog websites relevant to your topic, newspapers, and other sources with large userbases.

If you need some direction on channels to share to here is a list we compiled for the community [https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/iNnqcEoNQUJTiNz7kNArz68g](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/iNnqcEoNQUJTiNz7kNArz68g)
