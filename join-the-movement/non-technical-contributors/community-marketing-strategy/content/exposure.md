# Third-Party Sites

There are thousands of sites which focus on providing a combination of reviews, analysis, opinions, financial information, and general content about Blockchain projects. If you ever stumble upon a Site that does not have MyBit listed in its directory or the content is incorrect, please reach out to them directly with the updated content \(we will share soon, once our new messaging is finalised\). If anything is not included in the updated content we share, then please ask Dan or Rory on [Telegram](https://t.me/mybitio) for the information you need for the site to update their information accordingly.
