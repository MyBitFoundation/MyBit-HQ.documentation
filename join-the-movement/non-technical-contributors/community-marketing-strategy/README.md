# Community Marketing

MyBit is a decentralised, open source product ecosystem. This means that for it to succeed, everyone who supports the vision, needs to contribute their "bit" to help achieve it and transform the world. 

There are countless ways to contribute which are outlined in the following pages. As always if you have any questions join the conversation on [https://t.me/mybitio](https://t.me/mybitio). 

Additionally there are some very basic rules that we strongly encourage ALL contributors to follow:

1. DO NOT Spam
2. DO NOT sound "salesy," instead sound sincere and approachable
3. DO NOT worry about rejection - it happens and should not bring you down, just brush it off and keep going!
