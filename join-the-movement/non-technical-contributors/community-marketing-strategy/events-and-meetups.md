# Events & Meetups

Events & Meetups are easy to organise and yield surprisingly effective results when hosted by community members and supporters instead of a company representative. This is because people often trust other people, but view companies as just trying to sell them on their product to make money. 

Meetups do not have to be formal nor super professional \(to start\). For the first meetup, just select a free location, invite some friends and encourage everyone to bring a plus 1. You can then either keep it informal \(with a quick speech about the project and then networking and answering questions\) or you can have it more formal with a presentation followed by questions and networking. At first, keep the content and discussion simple and see where the conversation takes you. 

Follow these steps to get started with your first meetup:

1. Create a group on meetup.com or facebook events.
2. Choose a date & time.
3. Select a location \(This is very easy. You do not have to formalise anything with a location, instead just choose a local bar, restaurant, or unique meeting point where people would enjoy attending. If it is normally busy, then call in advance and book a reservation. If space is limited then put a cap on the amount of attendees that can come\). 
4. Share the meetup on your social media accounts and with friends. Also encourage everyone to bring atleast 1 friend so you can expand your audience outside of your own network.
5. That's it! It's simple. If you need any guidance on presentations, topics, organisation, etc. just ask Dan or Rory on [https://t.me/mybitio](https://t.me/mybitio) and they will happily help you out! Also, take pictures! We would love to see the meetup group in action and help promote it!

To grow your audience and spread the vision of MyBit to more people it is important to host meetups atleast once per month. As your meetup group grows, you can expand the scope of your meetups with some of the following options:

1. Invite guest speakers to always have a fresh perspective and discussion
2. Promote a few dedicated group members over time to co-hosts so they can help you manage the logistics and organisation of the meetup group.
3. If the size of your group grows significantly and local restaurants or meeting points cannot handle the group size, then look for co-working spaces and other supportive venues that often will not charge. If they do charge a fee, then ask for donations from your group or charge a small membership fee. In return for the small free also provide food and beverages at the meetup so the group members view the fee as paying for dinner and/or drinks.
4. Depending on your audience you may be able to diversify into different meetups and events for different types of members in your group. This could include a development focused meetup, a business focused meetup, an introduction focused meetup, etc. Do not be worried if you do not have expertise to host a specific meetup \(such as development focused\), just ask your group community or personal network - chances are someone there will be happy to host the meetup or knows someone who is. 
5. If your group grows above 250 members then reach out to the MyBit team for support to help organise larger events such as hackathons, hands on demos, small conferences with multiple speakers, etc.
