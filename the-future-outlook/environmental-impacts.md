# Environmental Impacts

When processes are more efficient, less resources consumed.

 Less commercial buildings will need to be constructed due to a reduction in companies operating with traditional offices. This is also highly beneficial long-term as the world population continues to grow rapidly and space is finite.

Specifically to MyBit Go, if it stimulates the expansion and growth of the sharing economy, machine usage will be optimised creating less purchases. If you take a car for example, nearly everyone has one but only uses it a few hours per day. If it is shared between many people, then less cars are needed to be purchased resulting in less raw materials being consumed during the production process due to diminishing demand.
