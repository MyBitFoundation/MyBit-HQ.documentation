# Vision

  
MyBit was started by a group of industry veterans frustrated by the limitations of today’s financial systems. In a global economy where trust is invaluable and hard to come by, third party providers like lawyers, managers and deal brokers have created inefficiencies while taking large percentages as profits.  
  
Our vision is to utilise the power of smart contracts to eliminate the need for centralised sources of trust while creating a collaborative company structure that allows us to fund, incubate and scale the technology.    
  

For the last year, we’ve been using our seed funds to create functional products that deliver on our vision, because building is believing. We’re building for collaboration, cooperation, and the promise of an open world.
