# How it Works

Anyone can navigate to the [Transparency Portal](https://hq.mybit.io) and choose a project to view information on. Content which is available is internal communication, message boards, roadmap & calendar, docs & files, to do lists and daily updates.

To view what each MyBit team member worked on each day, follow these steps:

1. Choose "1. Open Community"
2. Select "Automatic Check-Ins"
3. Navigate to "What did you work on today?"
4. Select the date you wish to view
